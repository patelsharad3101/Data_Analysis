This is Kaggle dataset https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer.

This is a 4 layers Sequential Convolutional Neural Network for digits recognition trained on the MNIST dataset. I chose to build it with Keras API (Tensorflow backend). The whole process is divided into three major sections-
-The data preparation
-The CNN model and evaluation
-The results prediction and submission.
By using 4 layer CNN model and epochs = 30 & batch = 128, I achieved the accuracy of 99.98%.
